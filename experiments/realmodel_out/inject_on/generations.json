Manifold partitioned KV memories are a type of memory architecture that enables the simultaneous storage and retrieval of multiple key-value pairs. This architecture is significant because it can improve the performance and efficiency of various applications, such as databases, file systems, and caching systems, by reducing the overhead of sequential key-value pair access.

Centroid compression is a technique that reduces the dimensionality of the embeddings by selecting a representative subset of the original embeddings. This can help long-context transformers in several ways:\n    - Reduced memory requirements: By compressing the embeddings, the model requires less memory to store and process them, which can be beneficial for long-context"
