Manifold partitioned KV memories are a type of memory architecture that allows for the efficient use of KV memories in modern computing systems. The manifold partitioning approach enables the creation of multiple, independent memory spaces within a single KV memory, each with its own access pattern and performance characteristics. This allows for better resource utilization, improved"
